# java-core

This project contains demo codes on java-native features. 
Many of these features are exclusive and specific to Java and 
perhaps that makes Java special in a lot of ways. 

Table of contents:

1. Java Generics
2. Java Streams
3. JavaDoc Demo
4. Java Later Versions (9, 10, 11, 12, 13 & 14)
5.
