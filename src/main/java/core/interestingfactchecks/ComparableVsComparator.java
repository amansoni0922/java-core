/**
 * equals() is a form of limited comparison where we just check if two entities are equal or not. In more broad from of comparison we need
 * to know if two entities are equal and if not then which one is greater or which one is smaller. This forms the basis for sorting objects.
 * On custom objects the sorting is performed based on the members of the class aka class variables. For this Java provides two interfaces
 * to sort objects using data members of the class:
 * 		1. Comparable (defines natural order of sort for a class)(to sort objects of implementing class)
 * 		2. Comparator (is external to any class)(can sort objects of different classes based on common attributes)
 *
